Hi! I am currently a Senior Member of Technical Staff at The Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, CA. Before that, in April 2024 I received a PhD in Earth System Science from Stanford University.

At Aerospace, I work in the Physical Sciences Laboratories, using computational modeling and machine learning to develop next-generation technologies for satellites. At Stanford, I worked in the Remote Sensing Ecohydrology Lab, where I combined satellite remote sensing, modeling, and field measurements to characterize how plants interact with the water cycle.


Outside of science, I play the cello in various music groups, and I participate in Quiz Bowl, an academic knowledge competition.
