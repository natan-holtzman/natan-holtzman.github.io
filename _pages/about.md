Hi! I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate in Earth System Science at Stanford University. I work in the Remote Sensing Ecohydrology Lab advised by Prof. Alex Konings. My research combines satellite remote sensing, computer modeling, and field measurements to characterize how plants interact with the water cycle.
In my spare time, I enjoy music - currently playing the cello in a piano trio and singing in a choir - and participate in Quiz Bowl, an academic knowledge competition.
