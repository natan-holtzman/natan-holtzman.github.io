Hi! I'm a sixth-year PhD candidate in Earth System Science at Stanford University, planning to graduate in early 2024.

At Stanford, I work in the Remote Sensing Ecohydrology Lab advised by Prof. Alexandra Konings. My research combines satellite remote sensing, computer modeling, and field measurements to characterize how plants interact with the water cycle.


Outside of science, I play the cello in various music groups, and I participate in Quiz Bowl, an intercollegiate academic knowledge competition.
