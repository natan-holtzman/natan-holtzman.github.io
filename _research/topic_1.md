title: "Field demonstration of remote sensing of plant hydraulics"
excerpt: "| We measured microwave vegetation optical depth with a tower-mounted radiometer at Harvard Forest, while also measuring plant water potential within the radiometer field of view. Leaf water potential and VOD displayed similarly shaped diurnal and seasonal patterns.| ![Diurnal cycles of leaf water potential and VOD](/images/hf_diurnal.png) |"
