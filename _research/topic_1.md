title: "Field demonstration of remote sensing of plant hydraulics"
excerpt: "It's difficult to compare satellite observations of vegetation optical depth (VOD) with ground truth data because of the large pixel size of microwave satellite data. We circumvented this scaling issue by using a microwave radiometer on top of a 90-foot tower looking down directly at a patch of forest, so its field of view was small enough to be homogeneous.  This work was conducted at Harvard Forest with many collaborators including Alex Roy (U. Quebec Trois Rivieres) and Andreas Colliander (JPL). VOD and feaf water potential displayed similarly shaped diurnal and seasonal patterns.
