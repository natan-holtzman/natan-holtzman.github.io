title: "Inferring the times scale of plant water use planning"
excerpt: "Stomatal optimality models are popular tools for predicting how plants adjust their water use in response to drought. By developing a new model that integrates water use and photosynthesis over time, we are able to quantify the time horizon over which plants in different ecosystems conserve water. This work was a collaboration with Xue Feng's lab at the University of Minnesota.".
