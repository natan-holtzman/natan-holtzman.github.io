title: "Inferring the times scale of plant water use planning"
excerpt: "Stomatal optimality models are popular tools for predicting how plants adjust their water use in response to drought, but they typically make the unrealistic simplifying assumption that plants optimize a reward function at each instant independently. By developing a new model that integrates water use and photosynthesis over time, we can quantify the time horizon over which plants in different ecosystems conserve water. This work was a collaboration with Xue Feng's lab at the University of Minnesota.
