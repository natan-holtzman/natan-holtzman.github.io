title: "Regional climate and reservoir systems"
excerpt: "To understand future climate impacts on water storage and hydropower in California's large system of reservoirs, it is necessary to downscale climate predictions from global models. Working with Tamlin Pavelsky at UNC-Chapel Hill, I studied how to best configure a commonly used regional climate model and land surface model 
(WRF and Noah-MP) to produce realistic outputs of runoff into California reservoirs. An interactive visualization of this work is available [here](https://nholtzman.shinyapps.io/presapp_v2/). 
I have also worked with engineering researchers (Jon Herman at UC Davis) to study how biases in downscaled runoff are amplified when the model runoff is used in models of reservoir operations.
