title: "Model-data fusion to map plant hydraulic traits"
excerpt: "Plant hydraulic traits are being included in current land surface models, but the values of those traits at different places are largely unknown. 
With Alex Konings (Stanford) and Yanlan Liu (Ohio State), I combined a simple plant hydraulic model with observations from the AMSR series of satellites to estimate values of several plant traits around the world. We found that the spatial distribution of trait values does not correspond well to commonly used classifications of plant functional types.
